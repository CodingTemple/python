    <h2>Excel</h2>
    
    <h3>What is Excel?</h3>
    <p>
        Microsoft Excel is a powerful spreadsheet software that allows users to create, edit, organize, and analyze
        data.
        It uses a grid of cells arranged in rows and columns, where users can enter numbers, text, and formulas to
        perform calculations, make charts and graphs, and manage data.
        Excel is a popular tool used in businesses, schools, and personal life for a variety of purposes, such as
        budgeting, project management, data analysis, and reporting.
        It offers a wide range of features and functions, including mathematical functions, formatting options,
        conditional formatting, data validation, pivot tables, and macros.
        Excel's ease of use, versatility, and flexibility have made it an essential tool for many professionals across
        industries, and it continues to evolve with new features and
        capabilities to meet the changing needs of users.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Loading a File</h3>
    <p>
        After launching Excel, we are greeted by the <code>Home</code> screen. In this screen, we will see three
        different panes off to the left
        hand side. <code>Home</code>, <code>New</code>, and <code>Open</code>. We will click on the <code>Open</code>
        button to open the <code>Open</code> dialog box.
        Once we select the open button, we will want to click on <code>Browse</code> option to begin browsing the files
        on our computer,
        and select the file we want to open in Excel.
    </p>
    <p>
        With <code>.csv</code> files, Excel will infer the format it imports in. You can verify that the data has been
        loaded correctly by seeing the column names in the top row followed by data in each other row.
        Each row should have a value and each column should be a variable.
    </p>

    <h3>Creating Visualizations</h3>
    <p>
        Excel is a powerful tool that can be used to create compelling visualizations of data with minimal effort.
        Whether you're looking to create charts, graphs,
        or pivot tables, Excel offers a wide range of options to help you visualize your data in a way that is both
        informative and visually appealing.

        To get started with creating visualizations in Excel, you will need to select the rows or columns of data that
        you want to work with.
        This can be done by simply clicking and dragging the mouse over the cells that contain the data you want to use.

        Once you have selected the data, you can begin creating visualizations using the <code>Insert</code> tab in the
        Excel ribbon.
        This tab contains a range of options for creating visualizations, including charts, graphs, and pivot tables.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>For Example:</strong>

        If I wanted to create a bar chart of my data, I would select the cells containing the data I want to chart, then
        click on the <code>Insert</code>
        tab, selecting the <code>Bar Chart</code> option from the <code>Charts</code> section. Excel will automatically
        generate a bar chart based on the data that I have selected!
        We can use the <code>Design</code> tab to change the chart type to any available charts from

    <h2>MySQL</h2>
    
    <ol type="I">
        <li><a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/wb-installing.html">Read the documentation on installation
                of MySQL Workbench</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/wb-getting-started-tutorial-create-connection.html">Read the
                documentation on how to create a new connection</a></li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Walk-Through</h3>
    <h4>Create a Database</h4>
    <p>
        After installation of MySQL, we can open the Workbench, our GUI (Graphic User Interface) for MySQL operations.
        When opened, we are greeted by the MySQL welcome screen. Don't worry too much about the GUI yet, we will be
        covering over it in class.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the screen in bold letters is MySQL Connections. Next to this, is a small <code>+</code> button.
        This is how we will set up our new connection. Once we click on this, we will focus on the
        <code>Stored Connection</code>
        and the <code>Test Connection</code> variables. Click on <code>Connection Name</code> and name your connection
        <code>test</code>. After that, click on the
        <code>Test Connection</code> button to verify that you have a connection to your database you are trying to
        create. In the event that the connection fails,
        you may want to double check your firewall or antivirus. You should also make sure that you installed MySQL
        using the <b><i>MySQL Installer</i></b>.
        You may also need to open the port on your computer to accept connections!
    </p>
    <p>
        Once we test the connection and have verified that it works, click the <code>OK</code> button to create your
        first database.
        Then we can click on the connection name and open our database.
    </p>
    <h4><strong>Create a Table</strong></h4>
    <p>
        Structured Query Language (SQL) is a programming language used to manage and manipulate data in relational
        database systems. SQL is a standard language used across many database management systems,
        including MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL.

        To interact with a MySQL database, you use SQL commands to create, read, update, and delete data. SQL provides a
        powerful set of commands that allow you to
        query data, modify tables, and perform various operations on the data stored in a MySQL database.
        To create a table, we specify using SQL keywords <code>CREATE</code> and <code>TABLE</code>,
        giving a table name and the names of columns we wish to add to the table.
    </p>
    <p><strong>For Example:</strong></p>
    <pre>
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS products(
                id INT,
                product VARCHAR(50),
                quantity INT,
            )
        </pre>
    <p>
        In this example, we create the table <code>products</code> only if the table does not already exist. We
        instantiate the table with three different columns
        and give each column a name and the data type we expect to see in the column. You can read more about creating a
        table in SQL <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/mysql/mysql_create_table.asp">here</a>
    </p>
    <h4>Inserting Data</h4>
    <p>Once you have created a table in SQL, the next step is to add data to it. This is typically done using the
        <code>INSERT</code> keyword,
        which allows you to specify the values you want to insert into the table. To use the <code>INSERT</code>
        keyword, you will need to specify
        the name of the table you want to add data to, followed by the columns that you want to insert data into. You
        can then provide the values you want to insert into each column,
        either as a single value or as a set of values separated by commas.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>For Example:</strong>
        Let's say I had a products table with the columns <code>id</code>, <code>product_name</code>, and
        <code>quantity</code>. To add new products to
        this table, I would use the following statement.
    </p>

    <pre>
            INSERT INTO products
            VALUES(
                1,
                'banana',
                200
            )
        </pre>
    <p>
        In this example, we insert into the table <code>products</code> the values for the id column (1), the
        product_name column (banana), and the quantity column (200).
        For more on how to utilize the <code>INSERT</code> statement in MySQL, check out <a
            href="https://www.w3schools.com/mysql/mysql_insert.asp">this</a> resource.
    </p>
    <h4>Querying Data</h4>
    <p>Now that we have a table and data inside that table,
        what if I wanted to view my data? This is where queries come in! Queries are how we access and return data from
        a table. A query utilizes the SQL keyword <code>SELECT</code>
        to select the data that you want to have returned from the table to you or a user.
    </p>
    <div><strong>For Example:</strong></div>
    <pre>
            SELECT * FROM products
        </pre>
    <p>
        <code>*</code> in SQL has a special meaning. It will return all the data within a table!
        So, when we run our statement above, we will be returning all data available within our table.
    </p>

        <h3>Follow Along</h3>
        <p>
            After installing R and R Studio, we will launch R Studio. R Studio has a lot in it's GUI, all of
            which we will be covering over together during our course. Today, we will focus on the <code>new file</code>
            button, located in the top left corner of R Studio. We will create a new <code>.R, or R Script</code> file.
            Now that we have our new file, we can begin to work with R!
        </p>
        <h3>Variable Assignment</h3>
        <p>
            In R, a variable is a name that is assigned to a value or an object. Variable assignment is the process of
            assigning a value or an object to a variable name.
            This allows you to store data and use it later in your code. The most basic form of variable assignment in R
            is to use the assignment operator, which is represented by the <code><-</code> symbol.
            Notice that the assignment operand (<code><-</code>) points to the object recieving the value of the
            expression. While the <code>=</code> can be used to assign variables as well,
            it is frowned upon to use for variable assignments and is improper syntax. Assignments can also be made in
            the opposite direction, with <code>value -> variable_name</code>. Variables can take on any type of value;
            from lists, to arrays, to vectors, to characters, to integers, to double precision values!
        </p>
        <p>
            <div>
                <strong>For Example:</strong>
            </div>
        
            Let's say I wanted to create a variable named <code>x</code> and save the value <code>3</code> to it.
            The code would look like:
        </p>
        <pre>
            > x <- 3
            > print(x)
            3

            # Can also look like:
            > 3 -> x
            > x
            3
        </pre>
        <p>
            This code creates a variable named <code>x</code> and assigns it the value of <code>3</code>! We can then
            use the variable in our code to reference the value that
            was assigned to it. We can view that value by calling to the variable or wrapping it in a print statement.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can also assign variables using the <code>assign()</code> function! This is an equivalent to the code
            mentioned above.
        </p>
        <pre>
            > assign("x", 3)
            > print(x)
            3
        </pre>
        <h3>Working with Numerical Values</h3>
        <p>
            R allows users to perform a variety of operands with integer values. Some examples of these operands would
            be: <code>+</code>,
            <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>%%</code>, <code>%/%</code>. Let's take a look at how
            we can apply these to some numerical values:
        </p>
        <pre>
            # Create two numerical variables
            num_1 <- 3
            num_2 <- 5
            
            # Perform addition
            num_1 + num_2
            
            # Perform subtraction
            num_1 - num_2
            
            # Perform multiplication
            num_1 * num_2
            
            # Perform division
            num_1 / num_2
            
            # Perform floor division, returning the product of the division without a remainder
            num_2 %/% num_1

            # Perform modulus, returning the remainder of the division
            num_2 %% num_1
        </pre>
        <h3>Character Manipulation</h3>
        <p>
            In programming, strings are a fundamental data type that represent a sequence of characters. Python and R
            are two popular programming languages used in data
            analytics and statistical computing, and they both have different terminologies for strings. In Python,
            strings are referred to as "strings". A string is a sequence of
            characters enclosed within single quotes, double quotes, or triple quotes. Strings can be manipulated using
            various built-in string methods such as slicing, concatenation, and formatting.
            In contrast, R uses the term "Character" to refer to a string-type object. In R, a character is a sequence
            of characters enclosed within double quotes. Like Python, R also provides
            several built-in functions to manipulate character strings, such as <code>nchar()</code> to count the number
            of characters in a string, <code>substr()</code> to extract a substring from a character string, and
            <code>paste()</code> to concatenate multiple strings.
        </p>
        <p>
            What if I wanted to create two character strings and save them to the variables
            <code>my_first_name</code> and <code>my_last_name</code>? The code for that would look like:
        </p>
        <pre>
            > my_first_name <- "Alex"
            > my_last_name <- "Lucchesi"
        </pre>
        <p>
            Now, we have our two variables containing our name. How can I change this into a single variable
            named <code>my_full_name</code> instead? In R, we can utilize the <code>paste</code> function.
            <code>paste</code> concatenates values given, spearating them by a <code>sep</code> argument.
        </p>
        <p><strong>For Example:</strong></p>
        <pre>
            > my_full_name <- paste(my_first_name, my_last_name, sep=' ')
            > print(my_full_name)
            Alex Lucchesi
        </pre>
        <p>
            We can also use the print() function to concatenate pieces of our print statement with variables
            we have created.
        </p>

        <pre>
            # Print a character string that has "My name is:" and our full name
            > print("My name is:", my_full_name)
            My name is: Alex Lucchesi
        </pre>
        <h3>Vectors</h3>
        <p>
            R operates on named <i>data structures</i>. The simplest data structure in R is the numeric <i>vector</i>,
            which consists of a single entity of an ordered collection of numbers.
            In R, we will work a lot with vectors. A vector is like a list in Python, but can only hold a single
            data type. Vectors are highly functional and an important part of Data Analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
            To create a vector, we use the <code>c()</code> function in R, passing in the values we wish to add to the
            vector,
            separated by a comma.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>For Example:</strong></p>
        <br>
        <pre>
            # Create a numerical vector and save it to the variable my_vec
            > my_vec <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)
            > print(my_vec)
            1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
        </pre>
        <br>
        <p>
            Numerical vectors support element-wise operations; meaning we can add,
            subtract, multiply, and divide vectors across each value in each vector.
        </p>
        <p><strong>For Example:</strong></p>
        <pre>
            # Create a new numerical vector and save it to the variable my_vec2
            > my_vec2 <- c(9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1)
            
            # Create a new variable named my_added_vec which adds both vectors together
            > my_added_vec <- my_vec + my_vec2
            
            # View the new vector
            > print(my_added_vec)
            10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10

            # Square a vector
            > my_added_vec ^ 2
            100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100
        </pre>
        <p>
            Vectors also support common arithmetic functions, such as log, exp, sin, cos, tan, and sqrt.
            We can also use aggregate statistical functions such as max, min, length, sum, prod, mean, and median.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can also <b><i>recycle</i></b> vectors. Vector recycling refers to using a shorter vector and a longer
            vector to complete computations.
            When we do this, we recycle the shorter vector, causing it to repeat itself from the beginning of the vector
            until it reaches the end of the second vector!
        </p>
        <p><strong>For Example:</strong></p>
        <pre>
            > vec_1 <- c(1,2)
            > vec_2 <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6)
            > vec_1 * vec_2
            1, 4, 3, 8, 5, 12
        </pre>
        <p>
            R can also generate sequences of numbers! A sequence is just like the <code>range()</code> function in
            Python, which generates number between a <i>start</i> and a <i>stop</i> value.
            We can define a sequence a couple of different ways. One is to use the <code>seq()</code> function to
            generate a sequence. Generating a sequence using this function allows you to also specify
            a <b><i>step</i></b>, or <b><i>by</i></b> argument. This argument specifies how much we want to increase the
            values within the sequence by.
            The other would be to use the <code>:</code> operand to create the sequence
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>For Example:</strong>
        </p>
        <pre>
            # Generate a simple sequence using the seq() function
            > seq(1, 10)
            1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

            # Generate a sequence using the <i>by</i> argument
            > seq(1,10, by=.2)
            1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.8, ..., 9.6, 9.8, 10
            
            # Generate a sequence using the <i>:</i> operand
            > 1:10
            1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
        </pre>
        <p>
            Two things to note here are that using the <b><i>by</i></b> argument, we can assign a decimal value and
            return values that are instead decimal(double precision) values.
            The other thing to note is that when using a generator, it is <b>inclusive</b> of the stop value. Meaning
            the final value you give the generator will be returned as well,
            which differs from Python, where the <code>range()</code> function is non-inclusive of the stop value!
        </p>
        <p>
            A function that is related to the <code>sep()</code> function is the <code>rep()</code> function. This
            function allows us to repeat or replicate values or objects in various ways.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>For Example:</strong>
        </p>
        <pre>
            # Use the rep() function to replicate a single value
            # Times allows us to specify the number of times we want a value to be replicated
            > rep(5, times = 5)
            5, 5, 5, 5, 5

            # Use the rep() function to replicate a vector
            # Each allows us to specify the number of times we want each value in the vector to be replicated before moving onto the next value in the object.
            > rep(my_added_vec, times = 5, each = 5)
            10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10, ..., 10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10
            10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10, ..., 10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10
            10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10, ..., 10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10
            10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10, ..., 10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10
            10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10, ..., 10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10
        </pre>
        <p>
            Sometimes, parts of a vector may not be completely known. When a value is "not available", or a "missing
            value", the vector assigns it the value of <b>NA</b>.
            Anytime we attempt to perform an operation on a <b>NA</b> value, we will return a <b>NA</b>, since the value
            is unknown.
            We can check if a null value exists using the function <code>is.na()</code>. This will return a logical
            vector where each instance of a null value is listed as TRUE
            and each non-null value is returned as FALSE.
        </p>
        <pre>
            # Create a vector with a null value
            > v <- c(1,2,NA,3)

            # Check for null values
            > is.na(v)
            FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE
        </pre>
        <p>
            Sometimes, we may not want to return all the values in a vector. We may only be interested in a couple
            values from it.
            We can use indexing to return a subsection of a vector. Indexing a vector is done by calling to the vector
            and using square brackets immedietely after the
            expression. Indexing can use the position in the vector that the value we want to call to is located at. For
            example, in our vector <code>v</code>,
            if we wanted to access the value of <code>NA</code>, we would call the index position of <strong>3</strong>,
            as it is the third value inside the vector!
            We can also give a range of numbers as an indexor, returning all the values within that range!
        </p>
        <pre>
            # Index a vector and grab the NA value
            # Note that index positions start at the value of 1!
            > v[3]
            NA

            # We can also use negative numbers to index a vector.
            # Using a negative number allows us to access the last value within the vector
            > v[-1]
            3

            # Index a vector using a range
            > v[1:3]
            1, 2, NA

            # Index a vector using a negative range
            > v[-(1:3)]
            2, NA, 3 
        </pre>
        <p>
            We can get even more functionality out of indexing a vector. Vectors can be accessed using a logical
            statement as well, where the values that match the conditional
            statement are what is returned to us! To do so, we would place the conditional statement inside the square
            brackets instead of an index position number.
        </p>

        <pre>
            # Return only the values in v that are not NA values
            > v[!is.na(v)]
            1, 2, 3
        </pre>
